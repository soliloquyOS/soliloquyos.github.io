      <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>so! this is the start of a pretty exciting
        project: soliloquyOS. a foss operating system built from the ground up
        for vr. unlike every other vr os on the market, soliloquyOS is being
        built from the ground up to be used for 3d interfaces, not floating 2d
        windows in a 3d space.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>i guess i'm starting this project because this
        is something that i would actually <i>want</i> to use. currently,
        there's no real reason for me to use vr over a traditional display on a
        laptop or desktop for my everyday computing tasks. game development,
        making npr artwork in blender, colour grading in resolve, standard web
        browsing stuff, etc. but soliloquy would ideally give me some sort of
        reason to do these tasks in vr.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>i've decided to open source this because i
        believe that the democratisation of software is important. i mean who
        even benefits from software being completely closed source? besides
        corporations that want to get stupidly rich, lol. so yeah, feel free to
        steal this code. it's free under an MIT license. and maybe even
        contribute if you're feeling kind :)
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>oh, and just as a small aside here, i don't
        plan on having backwards compatibility for any other programs. i mean
        how could you? soliloquy is meant to run applications with 3d
        interfaces. and i don't know any programs currently, no matter how
        baisc, that <i>have</i> 3d interfaces. and so, to mark the occasion,
        i've decided against using MSWIN4.1 as my bdb_oem. instead opting for:
      </p>
      <pre><code>bdb_oem:                    db 'slqy-os '       ;8 bytes</code></pre>
      <br />
      <p>
        <span class="tab"></span>now. progress. where am i at so far? well, not
        far. i've only started work on soliloquy i think 2 days ago. i've got a
        logo (which still needs a name):
      </p>
      <img src="/img/logo.png" alt="soliloquy os logo" />
      <p>
        i also have a super simple kernel that displays a message using bios
        interrupts:
      </p>
      <img
        src="/img/hello-world.png"
        alt="current state of soliloquy os kernel"
      />
      <p>
        and a bootloader with a fat12 file system. that's it. very early days at
        the moment. over the next few weeks, i want to try and display an image
        in soliloquy. and a terminal would be cool too. i'm not quite sure
        <i>when</i> i should start tailoring the os for vr, but i guess i'll
        figure that out when i come to it. ok, that's it for now. cheers :)
